# GraphSemiSupLabelProp

This repository contains the implementation of <b>GraphSemiSupLabelProp</b>, a semi-supervised machine learning project developed for the Theory of Graphs course. The project focuses on utilizing label propagation, a powerful algorithm for semi-supervised learning, specifically the part related to label propagation, within the context of graph theory.

## Project Overview

<p align="justify"> The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of label propagation using the <b>make_moons</b> and <b><b>make_circles</b> datasets from the <b>sklearn</b> library in Python, as well as custom CSV datasets obtained from the website <b>statsim</b>. The implemented code propagates labels iteratively based on distance calculations, radial basis function (RBF) kernels, and scaling operations</p>.

## Features

<p align="justify">Implementation of label propagation for semi-supervised learning in the context of graph theory.
Utilizes <b>make_moons</b> and <b>make_circles</b> datasets from <b>sklearn</b> library.
Utilizes custom CSV datasets (<b>make_moons</b> and <b>make_spirals</b>) obtained from <b>statsim</b> website.
Propagates labels iteratively using distance matrix, RBF kernel, and scaling techniques.
Supports the exploration and experimentation of label propagation algorithms.
Usage
To run the code and reproduce the experiments, follow these steps:</p>
